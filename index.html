      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
     	I love to explore different types of cultural food. I have an Instagram Food page, where I review and share photos of restaurants I have visited. I believe eating meals or cooking together is a great way to get to know one another or it is simply a good way to spend quality time with your loved ones.
